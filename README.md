> Exoplanet discovery has advanced through missions like Kepler, K2, and TESS, which use the transit method to detect planets by observing dips in starlight. These missions provide publicly available datasets containing information on confirmed exoplanets, candidates, and false positives, including orbital periods, transit durations, and planetary radii. While much of the analysis has historically been manual, recent research shows that machine learning can automate exoplanet identification with high accuracy, especially when combined with proper data preprocessing. Leveraging these datasets can accelerate discoveries of previously hidden exoplanets.
